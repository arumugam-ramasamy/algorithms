- Coding question: Given an array that represent a row of seats in a movie theater,
   where 0 represents an empty seat and 1 represents a occupied seat,
   return the index of a empty seat that is the most socially distant from the other patrons.

Round 1 : (Hackerearth based test) [Time : 1h15m]  This round had 2 questions.
Given an array of size N and K queries, find the number of segments containing the index(from queires) which is leftmost or rightmost and the number at index is >= each
elements of that segment Eg : arr[] = [1,2,3] K = [3] -> o/p : 3 ([3],[2,3][1,2,3]) Modification of this question(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/).

 Round 2 : F2F [Time : 1h]  Given an array and a target sum k, find all a[i] + a[j] = k. Follow up: handle if the array has both duplicate and non-duplicate elements

Given staircase on which you can climb 1,2 or 3 steps at time. Give count of all combinations to reach top of staircase.
 
 Doubly linked list, find middle element and delete.
 
 Remove all occurence of a character out of string in array.

Write a program in Java to assess a given string whether it complies with following patterns. Return true if a given string complies with these patterns else false.
 
 N = N1 + N2 
 N>= N1 >= N2
 where N is the Nth element in the string or element at Nth position;
 N1 is the (N-1) element in the string & N2 is the (N-2) element in the string.
 
 Example 1: 224610 
 Elements in this string are 2, 2, 4, 6, 10. 
 First Set: 2+2=4 (N2=2; N1=2 & N= 4); 
 Second Set: 2+4=6 (N2=2; N1=4 & N=6); 
 Third Set: 4+6=10 (N2=4; N1=6 & N= 10)
 
 Example 2: 1112233558 
 Elements in this string are 1, 11, 12, 23, 35, 58
 
 Example 3: 1101102203 
 Elements in this string are 1, 101, 102, 203

1st: one medium LC question + technical deep-dive into some frameworks.
- 2nd: one easy LC question + API design + some high-level system design questions + questions about cache, SSL
- 3rd: behavioral + career goals
- 4th: high-level system design of marketplace system + one easy LC question.
- 5th: questions about REST concepts and OOP concepts + one medium LC question.
Overall, I think the coding questions were doable if you practice enough. The design questions were also straightforward with enough prep work/experience. The technical framework deep-dive was the most difficult as it involves the theory behind some of the technology I used in day-2-day work but barely explored them enough.
I heard back from the recruiter about 1 week later that an offer is coming.
