# kafka-utilities

# who_in_isr
When I have under replicated partitions in my kafka cluster, this handy utility lets me know if a particular broker is at fault.

# ConsumerGroupLag
A faster alternative to kafka-consumer-groups.sh, that can also output the information as JSON. Useful for piping into scripts.
